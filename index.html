            at the California Institute of Technology. I have a genius-level IQ. Consequently,
            I have worked on many scientific projects. Instead of discussing these projects,
            you would probably be more interested in learning about my friends. I have even
            included another section which lists some of my hobbies. I am so brilliant that my skills
            go without mentioning!
